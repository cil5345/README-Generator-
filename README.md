Generates a README file for projects using command line.

## My README Generator
My generator creates a README file using Node.js. The user fills all information through prompts (i.e what is your project name?). When all questions have been answered, the README generator creates a markdown file with the user's input and their github email and profile picture. Npm inquirer has been used.

## Improvements
The next step would be to add a dynamic button on the page. The current button is just appened to the page, however I would like the button to dynamically change depending on if the project is active or not.

## Conclusion 
The README generator is a utility that developers would use for every project. It is a quick way to create README without all the hassles.
